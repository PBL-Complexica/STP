### Back description

Environment Setup: The code starts by importing necessary libraries and setting up the Flask application. The dotenv library is used to load environment variables, which includes the secret key for JWT. The JWTManager is then initialized with the Flask app.

User Registration: The /signup endpoint allows new users to register. It takes a phone number and password from the user, hashes the password using SHA256, and stores the hashed password along with the user's phone number. Note that this is a simplified version of user registration; in a real-world application, you would store this data in a database and include more fields such as email, name, etc.

User Login: The /login endpoint authenticates users. It checks if the provided phone number is registered and if the hashed version of the provided password matches the stored hashed password. If both checks pass, it generates and returns an access token and a refresh token using the create_access_token and create_refresh_token functions. These tokens are JWTs that contain the user's phone number (the identity) and are signed with the secret key.

Token Refresh: The /refresh endpoint generates a new access token from a provided refresh token. This is useful when the access token expires but the user still wants to stay authenticated.

Protected Routes: The /protected, /user_information, /subscription_manager, /device_manager, /payment_information, and /payment_manager endpoints are protected, meaning they require a valid access token to access. The @jwt_required() decorator ensures this. If a valid token is provided, the endpoints return some data to the user.

JWT in the Code: JWTs are used to authenticate users. When a user logs in, they are issued an access token and a refresh token. The access token is used to authenticate the user in protected routes, while the refresh token is used to get a new access token when the old one expires. The get_jwt_identity() function is used to get the identity (in this case, the phone number) of the user from a provided token.
